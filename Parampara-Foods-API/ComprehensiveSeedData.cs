Organic Certification:
- Regulated by government standards
- Requires third-party certification
- Prohibits synthetic pesticides and fertilizers
- No genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
- Specific animal welfare standards
- Regular inspections and audits

Natural vs Organic:
- 'Natural' has no legal definition for food
- 'Organic' is strictly regulated and certified
- Natural products may still contain chemicals
- Organic products must meet strict standards
- Natural is often a marketing term
- Organic requires certification and verification

Reading organic labels:
- 100% Organic: All ingredients are organic
- Organic: At least 95% organic ingredients
- Made with Organic: At least 70% organic ingredients
- Specific organic ingredients: Less than 70% organic

Why choose certified organic:
- Guaranteed standards and practices
- Third-party verification
- Environmental benefits
- Health benefits
- Support for sustainable agriculture
- Transparency in production methods

At Parampara Foods, all our organic products are certified by recognized organic certification bodies. We believe in transparency and provide detailed information about our sourcing and certification processes.

Making informed choices:
- Look for organic certification seals
- Read ingredient lists carefully
- Understand the difference between terms
- Support companies with transparent practices
